## What This Project Does

AeroClimbOptimizer shows airlines how to fly smarter and save money. It:

- Finds ways to use less fuel during the climb phase of flights
- Shows how much CO₂ and money airlines can save
- Creates easy-to-understand charts and reports
- Helps airlines make better decisions about flight operations

## Business Benefits

### Save Money
- **Cut Fuel Costs**: Save 5-15kg of fuel on each flight
- **Quick Results**: For an airline with 100 daily flights, that's $182,500-$547,500 saved every year
- **Fast Payback**: Start saving money within months of implementation

### Meet Green Goals
- **Reduce CO₂**: Cut carbon emissions by hundreds of tons yearly
- **Comply with Rules**: Help meet government emissions requirements
- **Green Reputation**: Show customers you care about the environment

### Improve Operations
- **Better Data**: See which airports and routes need improvement
- **Simple Fixes**: Make small changes that add up to big savings
- **Easy to Use**: Dashboard shows clear results without technical knowledge

## Real-World Value Example

For a medium-sized airline flying 50,000 flights per year:

| Savings Per Flight | Annual Fuel Savings | Annual Cost Savings | CO₂ Reduction |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 5kg                | 250,000 kg          | $250,000            | 787 tons      |
| 10kg               | 500,000 kg          | $500,000            | 1,575 tons    |
| 15kg               | 750,000 kg          | $750,000            | 2,362 tons    |

## How It Works

The dashboard has four main sections:

1. **Overview**: Shows fuel and emissions savings across different airports
2. **Savings Calculator**: Enter your flight numbers and see potential savings
3. **Key Factors**: See what affects fuel use the most
4. **Environmental Impact**: Track your emissions reductions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AeroClimbOptimizer.git
   ```

2. Install needed software:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## About This Project

I built this project during my internship with SITA to show how airlines can save money and reduce emissions at the same time. It's inspired by real aviation industry needs for better fuel efficiency.
